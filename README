## Annuity Calculator 

Simple annuity calculator that calculates a future and present value of an annuity based on number of years, interest rate,
and annual payment. It was made as part of an Honors Contract for a finance class at ASU. The calculator was made
with Electron and uses BootStrap for styling.

One of the main things you can do here is calculate how much you can take out annually from your retirement savings at a certain 
interest rate for a specified number of years. The amount of money you would have at retirement is calculated via FVIFA and then how much you can
take out annually after retirement is calculated via PVIFA.
